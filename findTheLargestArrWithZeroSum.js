// Write a JavaScript program to find the largest subarray in an integer array that has a sum of 0.
// Can you explain your approach to solving this problem and provide a step-by-step explanation
// of your code? How does your program handle edge cases, such as when there is no subarray
// with a sum of 0 or when the input array is empty?
